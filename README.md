This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with AsyncStorage in Expo applications.  The bug showcases a race condition where the app attempts to use AsyncStorage before it's properly initialized, resulting in unpredictable errors. The solution provided uses a promise-based approach to ensure AsyncStorage is ready before proceeding.  This pattern is crucial to prevent data corruption and unexpected app behavior.
